I've settled on using code derived from ov7670-no-ram-arduino-uno. I'm able to get what appears to be an
oversaturated image from it using VGA/Bayer RGB. Plus it's more pleasant to work with than INOs.

What I want to do next is see if the default register settings it has are incorrect. I'm going to explore other
more recent libraries to see what their settings are.
